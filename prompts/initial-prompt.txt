The target firmware has been executed with Penguin and the initial config.yaml.

Reason through the following Penguin output to find important errors/failures and figure out what you should address first using your tools.

IMPORTANT TIPS:
1. You do not need to initiate the rehosting process each time. That will happen automatically. Do not invoke a tool to run Penguin.
2. Prioritize new failures that arise after you have made a change because these likely arose from deeper execution into the control flow of the firmware.
3. Do not make the same tool call with the same arguments. This is redundant and serves no purpose.
4. Just because you see a pseudofile failure, it doesn't mean you should immediately add it. Reason through the console log, the number and type of accesses, etc. to find the most impactful intervention.
